## Getting Started

Welcome to our BTO Management System repository.
This is a system designed to manage the allocation nand tracking of Build-To-Order (BTO) flats. 
This tool helps users track their application status, manage their data, and generate reports.


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains a few folders, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `bin`: the folder to maintain binaries
- `docs`: the folder for javadocs
- `data`: the folder for data CSVs


Clone the repository: https://github.com/zixuantannn/sc2002-bto.git
Open in your Java IDE
Navigate to src > main > BTO_app.java 
Run BTO_app.java to start the application
